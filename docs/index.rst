**AI-Driven PAM Annotation & Visualization Hub**

This is yet another PAM annotation tool (YAPAT). Designed for efficient analysis of PAM data, YAPAT utilizes machine learning to prioritize samples for expert annotation (as in `Kath et al., 2024 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954124002528>`_).
The integrated interactive visualization suite combines embedding, dimensionality reduction, and clustering for dynamic data exploration.
